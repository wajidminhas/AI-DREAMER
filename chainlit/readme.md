## Cursor Rules:

When working in Python always use UV as package manager.

Instead of writing code you can use cli to run commands where it's efficient like when prompted to create new project using uv use: 

Packaged applications
Many use-cases require a package. For example, if you are creating a command-line interface that will be published to PyPI or if you want to define tests in a dedicated directory.

The --package flag can be used to create a packaged application:

    uv init --package example-pkg

And to install packages in project

To add a dependency:

    uv add crewai
